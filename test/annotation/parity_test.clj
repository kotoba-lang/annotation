(ns annotation.parity-test
  "Parity gate between `src/annotation/core.kotoba` (the semantic authority) and
  `src/annotation/core.cljc` (the load path a Clojure/ClojureScript consumer requires).

  Shape follows `kotoba-lang/css` (`css.kotoba-parity-test`), `kotoba-lang/dsl-core`
  and `kotoba-lang/async` (ADR-2608130900), and `kotoba-lang/postfx` (ADR-2608133600):
  the `.kotoba` is compiled here and executed through the KIR interpreter in this same
  JVM, so nothing crosses a runtime boundary, and `kotoba-lang/compiler` stays a
  test-only dependency. These functions take and return typed `:document` values, so
  the comparison encodes the `.cljc` output into the same tagged document form the
  interpreter hands back (`->doc`).

  WHY THE .cljc EXISTS AT ALL. `775081a4` (2026-07-20) deleted
  `src/annotation/core.cljc` and put the `.kotoba` at that path. A `.kotoba` is on no
  Clojure classpath, so `annotation.core` stopped being loadable by every runtime this
  workspace ranks above the native path. The `.cljc` restored beside it is the load
  path; the `.kotoba` remains the authority.

  SEMANTICS DECISION: VERBATIM, WITH FOUR DIVERGENCES ASSERTED. This is the opposite
  call from `dsl-core`/`async`, and the reason is measured, not stylistic. There the
  guest had FIXED something — it made a self-contradicting predicate consistent and
  made an unvalidated constructor fail closed — so the restored `.cljc` adopted the
  guest. Here the guest is NARROWER than the function it replaced:

    * it drops the W3C `styleClass` mapping that `specific-resource` performed,
      emitting the caller's `:style` key verbatim, which is not a Web Annotation
      property name;
    * it drops the guaranteed `:source` key that `specific-resource` always emitted;
    * it traps on a non-map document where `errors` used to return a diagnosable
      `:annotation/document-must-be-map` problem.

  Adopting the guest would mean shipping a Web Annotation library that emits a
  non-spec property name. So the restored file is the pre-migration file unchanged
  (`775081a4^`), and each divergence is named and asserted below rather than
  quietly excluded from the comparison. This mirrors what `async` did with its
  capacity bound: where the migration is narrower than the contract, the divergence
  is the finding.

  Everything else — the `@context` and `Annotation` defaults, both `text-body`
  arities including the `opts` override, `fragment-selector`,
  `text-position-selector`, and `errors`/`validate` over map documents — is compared
  for equality."
